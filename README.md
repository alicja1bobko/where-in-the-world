## My process

### Built with

- CSS grid
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react.html)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.com/)

### What I learned

This project was another opportunity to practice Typescript, this time with API. I've used also Vite instead of create React app for the first time, which turned out to be super fast and easy to use. It was also a great opportunity to further practice of Tailwind. I've learned how to use Intersection Observer to implement Infinite scroll.
